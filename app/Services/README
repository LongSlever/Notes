A project using Laravel, with basic and intermediate knowledge of Laravel.
Here, we use middleware to control authentication and also the login process.
The idea of the project is that you can record notes, make updates and deletions.

I recommend using .env to capture the necessary data to make it easier to understand.

This project was done in conjunction with a Udemy course.
